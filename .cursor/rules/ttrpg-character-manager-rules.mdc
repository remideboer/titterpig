You are a senior Software Engineer and Architect with senior experience in the Flutter/Dart framework
and a preference for creating maintainable systems with emphasizes on clean programming, proper OO
practices, design patterns and scalable architectural designs.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.
Prefer the use of reusable, DRY screen elements.

### Code Quality and Refactoring

Cursor MUST continuously monitor for code smells and apply appropriate refactoring techniques.
When code smells are detected, Cursor MUST either prevent the change
or suggest/apply proper refactoring patterns.

#### Code Smell Categories to Monitor

1. Bloaters
   - Long Method (> 20 lines)
   - Large Class (> 200 lines)
   - Primitive Obsession
   - Long Parameter List (> 4 parameters)
   - Data Clumps

2. Object-Orientation Abusers
   - Switch Statements
   - Temporary Field
   - Refused Bequest
   - Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces

3. Change Preventers
   - Divergent Change
   - Shotgun Surgery
   - Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies

4. Dispensables
   - Comments (when they explain complex code that should be refactored)
   - Duplicate Code
   - Lazy Class
   - Data Class
   - Dead Code
   - Speculative Generality

5. Couplers
   - Feature Envy
   - Inappropriate Intimacy
   - Message Chains
   - Middle Man
   - Insider Trading

#### Common Refactoring Techniques to Apply

1. Composing Methods
   - Extract Method: Move code fragment into a separate method
   - Inline Method: Replace method call with method body
   - Replace Temp with Query: Extract expression into method
   - Replace Method with Method Object: Transform method into separate class

2. Moving Features
   - Move Method: Move method to another class
   - Move Field: Move field to another class
   - Extract Class: Split class into two
   - Inline Class: Merge two classes

3. Organizing Data
   - Encapsulate Field: Make field private and provide accessors
   - Replace Data Value with Object: Replace primitive with object
   - Replace Array with Object: Replace array with object
   - Replace Type Code with Class: Replace primitive type code with class

4. Simplifying Conditional Expressions
   - Decompose Conditional: Split complex conditional into methods
   - Consolidate Conditional Expression: Combine similar conditionals
   - Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses: Flatten conditionals
   - Replace Conditional with Polymorphism: Replace conditional with inheritance

5. Making Method Calls Simpler
   - Rename Method: Change method name to better reflect purpose
   - Add Parameter: Add parameter to method
   - Remove Parameter: Remove unused parameter
   - Separate Query from Modifier: Split method into query and modifier

6. Dealing with Generalization
   - Pull Up Field: Move field to superclass
   - Pull Up Method: Move method to superclass
   - Push Down Field: Move field to subclass
   - Push Down Method: Move method to subclass
   - Extract Interface: Define interface for class
   - Extract Superclass: Create superclass for similar classes

#### Implementation Rules

Cursor MUST:
1. Check for code smells before applying any changes
2. Prevent commits that introduce new code smells
3. Suggest appropriate refactoring techniques when code smells are detected
4. Include the specific refactoring technique name in commit messages
5. Link to the corresponding refactoring pattern in the catalog
6. Ensure refactorings maintain or improve code quality metrics
7. Apply refactorings incrementally to maintain code stability
8. Update tests to reflect refactored code structure

#### Commit Message Format for Refactorings

## Dart General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.
- When making code modifications Cursor MUST use proper refactoring techniques and
 Cursor must check, lint if modifications do not produce errors.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use underscores_case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

## Specific to Flutter

### Basic Principles

- Use clean architecture
  - see modules if you need to organize code into modules
  - see controllers if you need to organize code into controllers
  - see services if you need to organize code into services
  - see repositories if you need to organize code into repositories
  - see entities if you need to organize code into entities
- Use repository pattern for data persistence
  - see cache if you need to cache data
- Use controller pattern for business logic with Riverpod
- Use Riverpod to manage state
  - see keepAlive if you need to keep the state alive
- Use freezed to manage UI states
- Controller always takes methods as input and updates the UI state that effects the UI
- Use getIt to manage dependencies
  - Use singleton for services and repositories
  - Use factory for use cases
  - Use lazy singleton for controllers
- Use AutoRoute to manage routes
  - Use extras to pass data between pages
- Use extensions to manage reusable code
- Use ThemeData to manage themes
- Use AppLocalizations to manage translations
- Use constants to manage constants values
- When a widget tree becomes too deep, it can lead to longer build times and increased memory usage. Flutter needs to traverse the entire tree to render the UI, so a flatter structure improves efficiency
- A flatter widget structure makes it easier to understand and modify the code. Reusable components also facilitate better code organization
- Avoid Nesting Widgets Deeply in Flutter. Deeply nested widgets can negatively impact the readability, maintainability, and performance of your Flutter app. Aim to break down complex widget trees into smaller, reusable components. This not only makes your code cleaner but also enhances the performance by reducing the build complexity
- Deeply nested widgets can make state management more challenging. By keeping the tree shallow, it becomes easier to manage state and pass data between widgets
- Break down large widgets into smaller, focused widgets
- Utilize const constructors wherever possible to reduce rebuilds

### Testing

- Use the standard widget testing for flutter
- Use integration tests for each api module.

### Documentation

- Document all business rules, user stories, and features in the README.md file using Gherkin syntax
- Each feature should be documented with:
  - Feature: A high-level description of the feature
  - Background: Common context or setup for the scenarios
  - Scenario: A specific use case or test case
  - Given: The initial context or preconditions
  - When: The action or event that occurs
  - Then: The expected outcome or result
- Example Gherkin syntax structure:
  ```gherkin
  # User Goal: Access and manage my character data efficiently
  # User Story: As a player, I want to access my character data so I can manage my character's progress
  # Design Decision: Implement secure authentication with email/password
  # Specification: Authentication system requirements

  Feature: Character Data Access
    As a player
    I want to access my character data
    So that I can manage my character's progress and development

    Background:
      Given I am a registered player
      And I have created at least one character
      And I am on the character selection screen

    Scenario: Accessing character data
      Given I have selected my character "Dragon Slayer"
      When I click on the "View Details" button
      Then I should see my character's:
        | Attribute | Value |
        | Name      | Dragon Slayer |
        | Level     | 5 |
        | Class     | Warrior |
        | Experience| 1250 |
      And I should be able to edit these details

    Scenario: Managing character progress
      Given I am viewing my character's details
      When I complete a quest worth 500 experience
      And I click the "Update Progress" button
      Then my character's experience should increase by 500
      And I should see a success message
      And my character's level should update if enough experience is gained
  ```
- Keep the README.md file up to date with all new features and changes
- Use the Gherkin documentation as the single source of truth for feature requirements
- Ensure that all acceptance tests align with the Gherkin scenarios in the README
- When implementing new features, refer to the Gherkin documentation first
- Use the Gherkin scenarios to guide the development process and testing strategy
- Clearly separate and document:
  - User Goals: Why the user wants the feature (business value)
  - User Stories: What the user wants to do (user perspective)
  - Design Decisions: How we'll implement it (technical approach)
  - Specifications: Detailed requirements (testable criteria)

### Git Commit Messages

Follow the Conventional Commits specification with these guidelines:

- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
  - Types:
    - feat: New feature
    - fix: Bug fix
    - refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
    - docs: Documentation only changes
    - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
  - Scope: Optional, indicates section of codebase (e.g., models, ui, auth)
  - Description: Present tense, lowercase, no period at end

- Body format:
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <description>

  <detailed explanation of the change>

  - <bullet points for specific changes>
  - <another specific change>

  <reference to issues/tickets>
  ```

- Examples:
  ```

  ```

When writing commit messages:
- Be specific about what changed and why
- Include context that future developers would find helpful
- Reference any relevant issue numbers
- Keep lines in description under 72 characters
- Use bullet points for listing specific changes
- Separate subject from body with a blank line

### Cursor Commit Message Generation

After making any code changes, Cursor MUST:
1. Generate a commit message following the above format
2. Include the commit message in a "Suggested Git Commit" section at the end of the response
3. Format the suggested commit message in a code block
4. Ensure the commit message accurately reflects ALL changes made in that response
5. Include both the short form (first line) and detailed form (with explanation and bullet points)

Example response format:
```
[Regular response explaining changes...]

Suggested Git Commit:
```git
feat(auth): implement user authentication flow

Add secure authentication system with email/password login.

- Created AuthService for handling authentication
- Added login and registration forms
- Implemented secure password hashing
- Added session management

Part of #789
```

### Documentation Updates

When new business rules or job stories are introduced, documentation MUST be automatically updated following these guidelines:

#### Business Rules Documentation
When a new business rule is introduced:
1. Add to README.md under the "Business Rules" section using the format:
```gherkin
Rule ID: BR-[sequential number]
Description: [Clear description of the business rule]
Validation: [How to validate the rule is being followed]
Examples:
- [Example 1 showing rule application]
- [Example 2 showing rule application]
Dependencies: [List any related rules]
```

#### Job Stories Documentation
When a new job story is introduced:
1. Add to README.md under the "Job Stories" section using the format:
```gherkin
Story ID: JS-[sequential number]
When [situation/context]
I want to [motivation/desire]
So that [expected outcome/benefit]

Acceptance Criteria:
1. [Criterion 1]
2. [Criterion 2]
3. [Criterion 3]

Related Business Rules: [List related BR-IDs]
```

#### Documentation Generation Rules
Cursor MUST:
1. Automatically identify new business rules or job stories in code changes
2. Generate corresponding documentation in README.md
3. Include both the documentation update and code changes in the same commit
4. Add a reference to the documentation in code comments where the rule is implemented
5. Ensure cross-references between related business rules and job stories are maintained

Example documentation update:
```gherkin
Rule ID: BR-12
Description: Character spell limit follows Fibonacci sequence based on WIL stat
Validation: Verify spell count matches Fibonacci number for character's WIL stat
Examples:
- WIL 1 allows 2 spells
- WIL 2 allows 3 spells
- WIL 3 allows 5 spells
Dependencies: BR-08 (Base Character Stats)

Story ID: JS-45
When I increase my character's WIL stat
I want to automatically gain access to more spell slots following the Fibonacci sequence
So that I can expand my magical capabilities in a balanced and progressive way

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Spell limit follows Fibonacci sequence based on WIL
2. UI shows current spell count and limit
3. Cannot exceed spell limit when selecting spells
4. Excess spells are removed if WIL decreases

Related Business Rules: BR-12
```
```

This format ensures that:
1. All business rules and job stories are properly documented
2. Documentation focuses on the context and motivation of features
3. Relationships between rules and stories are clear
4. Implementation details can be traced back to requirements
5. Changes are properly tracked and validated

You can paste this section directly into your `.mdc` file, just before the JSON schema section at the bottom.

The key difference in this version is the use of Job Stories instead of User Stories, which provides:
- Better context through the "When" situation
- Clearer motivation through the specific desire
- More concrete expected outcomes
- Focus on the situation rather than user roles
- More specific and actionable requirements
